# Working with Data

The Meteor Admin SDK provides tools for accessing and manipulating Shopwell data from within the Administration. These APIs allow extensions to interact with Shopwell entities, react to changes in data, and update records using the same repository-based data layer used by the Administration itself.

Typical data workflows follow this pattern:

1. Access an entity repository
2. Retrieve entities or collections
3. Subscribe to updates or changes
4. Modify or persist data

## Data access and operations

- [Repository](./repository.md): Access Shopwell entity repositories.
- [Get](./get.md): Retrieve entity data from the Administration data layer.
- [Subscribe](./subscribe.md): React to changes in entity data.
- [Update](./update.md): Modify and persist entity data.
