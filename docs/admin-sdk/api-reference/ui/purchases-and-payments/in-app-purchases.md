# In-App Purchases

> Available since Shopwell v6.6.9.0

In-App purchases allow apps to unlock different functionality based on purchases made by the user. This guide covers how to start the in-app purchase flow directly from the Administration.

## purchase()

Open a modal with details about the feature that can be purchased.

#### Usage

```ts
import { iap } from "@shopwell-ag/meteor-admin-sdk";

iap.purchase({
  identifier: "your-in-app-purchase-id",
});
```

#### Parameters

| Name         | Required | Description                             |
| :----------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `identifier` | true     | The id of the in-app purchase to start. |

#### Return value

Returns a promise without data.

## Behavior

When called, Shopwell opens a purchase modal inside the Administration. The modal guides the merchant through the checkout flow for purchasing or subscribing to the feature.

After a successful purchase:

- The charge is added to the merchant's Shopwell bill
- The purchased feature becomes available in the app.
