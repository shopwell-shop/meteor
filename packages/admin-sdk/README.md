```

#### Using CDN:

## Features
- 🏗  **Works with Shopwell 6 Apps and Plugins:** you can use the SDK for your plugins or apps. API usage is identical.
- 🎢  **Shallow learning curve:** you don't need to have extensive knowledge about the internals of the Shopwell 6 Administration. Our SDK hides the complicated stuff behind a beautiful API.
- 🧰  **Many extension capabilities:** from throwing notifications, accessing context information or extending the current UI. The feature set of the SDK will gradually be extended, providing more possibilities and flexibility for your ideas and solutions.
- 🪨  **A stable API with great backwards compatibility:** don't fear Shopwell updates anymore. Breaking changes in this SDK are an exception. If you use the SDK, your apps and plugins will stay stable for a longer time, without any need for code maintenance.
- 🧭  **Type safety:** the whole SDK is written in TypeScript which provides great autocompletion support and more safety for your apps and plugins.
- 💙  **Developer experience:** have a great development experience right from the start. And it will become better and better in the future.
- 🪶  **Lightweight:** the whole library is completely tree-shakable and dependency-free. Every functionality can be imported granularly to keep your bundle as small and fast as possible.

## Examples

```js
sw.notification.dispatch({

})
```
